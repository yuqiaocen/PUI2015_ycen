## Background
Our team were really interested in whether younger people or older people are more likely to use citibikes. We did some research on the age at retirement in American and it is 60 years old. We made 60 as the division line. 
We came out the hypothesis based on these resons:
1. As citibikes are not the fastest vehicle for people who need to go to work, people use citibikes are more likely for sightseeing or relaxing.
2. Based on reason 1, retired people are more likely to have time to go sightseeing and relaxing.
At the end, we came out the null hypothesis: The bike durations of people under 60 are longer than or equal to the qurations of people over 60.
## What we did
First, we came out our null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis and chose the significance level together.
Second, I cleaned the data and plot them. I just focus on 'subscriber' because the data of 'customer'may not complete.
At last, we use t-test to test the hypothesis. As the result shown in the notebook, we reject the null hypothesis.
