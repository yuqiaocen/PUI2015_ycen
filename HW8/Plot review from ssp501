1. Clarity

I think the 3-D histogram make me a little confuse. I nearly cannot identify each column.

2. Esthetics

The color is good. But transparency make it confused.

Honesty

I think the data is honest.

Suggestion

There seems  not different between the number of death different years different cause. And the plot seems that just can tell us the numbers of death cause by different reason are different. Maybe plotting the number of every column will be better.
