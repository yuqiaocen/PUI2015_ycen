## Assignment 8
Just one plot this week! Choose to plot anything you wish, from the data we used so far. Please make it a good plot. Possibly choose data with more than 2 dimensions, so that you are challenging yourself to represent a third dimension graphically (e.g. time, distance, and gas consumed to travel would amount to 3 dimensions: if you had to plot them you could make a plot of distance v time, but you would have to come up with a graphical way to represent the gas usage: color, size, a third dimension...). 

Put thought into the esthetic of the plot, how clearly the content is communicated, avoid clutter, avoid misleading elements, mind your choice of colors accordingly to what was discussed in class. If you wish to violate these rules on purpose you can! but put thoughts into it as well please!
