the review were okk but superficial 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the plot is very busy. 

no point in starting at the negative range: remove the <0 space

two legends for the regression lines and the datapoints may be better: clearer less overwhelming

association of color to rage triggers preconceptions. since you have few categories shapes may be a better choice.






NOTES ON YOUR PLOT THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================

============

stack histograms are difficult to read: given the few bins side by side histogram would have been a better choice

Others should probably not be the first bin, but the last. otherwise reading left to right the reader does not know other from what

the last label is too long: split into 2 rows


legend way too small

choosing one category to be gray the other one a vivid color give the impression that one is more important or relevant than the other (which may or may not be intended given the context)



ssp501
============


the 3d as usual makes comparison difficult. additionally 3d bind distort the perception: we should compare differences in height but we are left with the impression given byt he difference in volumes

the color is redundant with the year 

tick labels too small

the cause of dheath axis labels are offset with respect to the variable

typo in the title (parenthesis close that was never open)




jn1573
============

nice visualization

some labels cannot be read (blue on blue)

the animation is jittery on roll over: add a delay to overcome that

the animation is also unnecessary since seecting a bubble does not d anything. teh circle around it would be justified if info appeared, to clarify what the info refers to

the zoom is also unnecessary as it does not reveal any details, just hides the details about the rest of the data
