###1. Clarity

I think plot is not really clear. It may be better if the plot separate the red column and gray column and mark the number on the top of the column.

###2. Esthetics

The color is good.

###3. Honesty

I think the data is honest.

###Suggestion

Separating the ren and gray column may be better and set a totle column to describe the data. In that way we may have a clear understand of the compare between the workers number inside and outside the subway area and the compare between different industries.
